## Challenges and Learnings

One key challenge was managing high traffic volumes and request patterns effectively. With 1300+ exercises and real-time search functionality, the platform needed protection against excessive requests that could overwhelm the system. The solution involved implementing intelligent rate limiting and request management to ensure consistent performance for all users while preventing system overload from automated traffic or excessive usage patterns.

## Outcome
