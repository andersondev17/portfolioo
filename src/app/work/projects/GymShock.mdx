## Overview

In Colombia, 60% of people face obesity and 70% abandon fitness programs due to mental barriers. GymShock eliminates the fear of judgment that prevents individuals from starting their fitness journey, combining enterprise-grade security together with empathetic design to democratize expert fitness guidance. Created to support UN SDG 3 (Health & Well-being) and SDG 8 (Decent Work), the platform serves both individuals seeking inclusive fitness access and trainers needing digital tools to expand practice.

**Current Status:** Active development with functional exercise database, user authentication, security and core assessment features implemented.

## Key Features

- **Remove Psychological Barriers**: Personal assessment system that adapts to the user's level, creating safe entry points for beginners who fear gym judgment.
- **Enterprise Security Architecture**: End-to-end security with DDoS protection, bot detection, rate limiting, and Passport.js multi-provider authentication of User/Trainer/Admin roles through an RBAC system.
- **Personalized Assessment Engine**: Personalized workouts generated through a survey-based assessment engine based on individual needs, fitness levels, and psychological comfort zones featuring 1300+ exercises, detailed instructions and progressive difficulty scaling.
- **Inclusive Design System**: Centralized Tailwind CSS tokens for consistency across the app, ensuring accessibility and responsive design that works for users on any device and level of technical competence.
- **Empowerment Tools**: Trainer dashboard enabling fitness professionals to digitize work with multiple clients at a distance, and build scalable income streams while maintaining personal connection with their expertise. *(In Development)*

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript with mobile-first component design.
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express, MongoDB, optimized for high-traffic scenarios and real-time search.
- **Security**: Multi-layered security with rate limiting and bot detection and DDoS protection.
- **Design**: Centralized token system enabling scalable theming and consistent user experience.

## Challenges and Learnings

The core challenge isn't technicalâ€”it is human. Research showed that 7 out of 10 people avoid starting fitness programs due to fear of judgment, rather than because they don't have access to the exercises. This implied rethinking the whole process from scratch: instead of building another "no pain, no gain" platform, our vision is a system that respects psychological barriers while providing professional-grade guidance.
The technical challenge is to deliver 1300+ exercises with response times less than a second. Caching methods are being implemented, MongoDB optimization, and rate limiting were used to address it.
## Outcome

GymShock can bridge the gap between technical and social impact. The platform demonstrates how this architecture can be used for the good of  vulnerable groups, with security measures that build trust rather than create barriers.

**Project Impact**: Designed to create economic opportunities for fitness trainers at scale

**Technical Achievements**: Scalable architecture designed to support concurrent users  with core systems achieving reliable uptime during development testing.

This project shows how technology design can address society's challenges delivering business viability and social impact
