## Overview

In Latin America, checkout processes often become tedious,. The goal was to feature WhatsApp billing integration. By integrating component libraries, this solution significantly reduced the time spent on a purchase, while maintaining what market needs.

## Key Features

- **Security**: Protection with rate limiting and threat detection.
- **WhatsApp Integration**: Orders go straight to merchant's WhatsApp - no complex setup needed
- **Admin Dashboard**: Product management, inventory tracking, and Web Vitals monitoring
- **Performance**: MongoDB optimization with design patterns for scalability

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS with clean, reusable components.
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express, MongoDB with Mongoose ODM for scalable data management.
- **Analytics**: Custom Web Vitals tracking with real-time performance monitoring.
- **Security**: Protection with rate limiting and threat detection.

## Challenges and Learnings

7 out of 10 carts get abandoned because people switch to WhatsApp to ask questions. Each interaction matters, you know? 
Instead of fighting this natural behavior, I designed a system that embraces it. The platform transitions from web browsing to WhatsApp, maintaining order context while letting customers interact the way they actually want to.

## Outcome

AMMAE transforms abandoned carts into an approach for commercial launch that truly understands itsÂ market.
